1080 
01:43:18,247 --> 01:43:21,512 
I don't know that I want to hear 
from any more experts. 

1081 
01:43:22,551 --> 01:43:25,213 
- That doesn't work! 
- We've been trying those things for years!

1082 
01:43:25,287 --> 01:43:26,914 
<i>Will you please let me finish?</i> 

1083 
01:43:26,989 --> 01:43:30,083 
<i>With intensive psychotherapy,</i> 
<i>an autistic child can be treated...</i> 

1084 
01:43:30,192 --> 01:43:33,559 
But the Rimland report plainly shows that 
autism is not a psychological problem. 

1085 
01:43:33,629 --> 01:43:35,927 
- <i>I am not familiar with the Rimland report.</i> 
- Calm down. Calm down. 

1086 
01:43:35,998 --> 01:43:37,863 
Calm down, sweetie. Sweetie, calm down. 
Calm down. 

1087 
01:43:37,933 --> 01:43:40,128 
<i>It would be better</i> 
<i>if you could get her to sit calmly.</i> 

1088 
01:43:40,202 --> 01:43:42,136 
- <i>You know, try to control her.</i> 
- <i>What are you talking about?</i> 

1089 
01:43:42,204 --> 01:43:45,196 
<i>But we were told self-stimming is good.</i> 
<i>It eventually calms them.</i> 

1090 
01:43:45,274 --> 01:43:47,071 
<i>Self-stimming is self- comforting.</i> 

1091 
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:50,670 
Self-stimulation, rocking, spinning, 
rolling on the floor, flapping the... 

1092 
01:43:50,746 --> 01:43:52,839 
Well, I think spinning is good. 

1093 
01:43:53,015 --> 01:43:54,846 
And rolling, too. 

1094 
01:43:54,917 --> 01:43:58,853 
Self-stimulation does seem to eventually 
calm the nervous system. 

1095 
01:43:58,921 --> 01:44:02,084 
It can be a way to compensate 
for not being held. 

1096 
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:04,388 
And being held by another person is scary, 

1097 
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:08,191 
but rolling or, 
or being held by surfaces produces 

1098 
01:44:08,264 --> 01:44:11,199 
the calming effect 
that ordinary children get from a hug. 

1099 
01:44:11,267 --> 01:44:12,700 
How old is your child? 

1100 
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:16,327 
Well, I don't have children. 

1101 
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:19,303 
No, I'm autistic. 

1102 
01:44:20,009 --> 01:44:22,910 
And I need the sensation of being hugged. 

1103 
01:44:23,445 --> 01:44:26,437 
And I've developed a machine 
that I get into and hugs me 

1104 
01:44:26,515 --> 01:44:29,541 
and I'm different afterwards. 
I'm more social. 

1105 
01:44:30,085 --> 01:44:32,519 
Well, I didn't speak until I was four 

1106 
01:44:32,588 --> 01:44:36,820 
and now I have a B.A. And a master's 
and I'm studying for my doctorate. 

1107 
01:44:37,059 --> 01:44:39,823 
- How did you learn to speak? 
- How's it possible? 

1108 
01:44:39,895 --> 01:44:42,261 
Please don't shout. Please don't... 

1109 
01:44:42,331 --> 01:44:47,200 
Most autistic people are very sensitive 
to sounds and colors. 

1110 
01:44:48,671 --> 01:44:51,265 
Over-stimulation hurts. 

1111 
01:44:52,641 --> 01:44:54,700 
You know, 
people talking too much at once, 

1112 
01:44:54,777 --> 01:44:56,506 
you know, can cause us to panic. 

1113 
01:44:56,579 --> 01:44:58,570 
How did you get cured? 

1114 
01:44:59,215 --> 01:45:02,651 
Well, I'm not cured. I'll always be autistic. 

1115 
01:45:03,219 --> 01:45:07,155 
My mother refused to believe 
that I wouldn't speak. 

1116 
01:45:07,289 --> 01:45:10,690 
And when I learned to speak, 
she made me go to school. 

1117 
01:45:11,293 --> 01:45:16,458 
And in school and at home, 
manners and rules were really important. 

1118 
01:45:16,632 --> 01:45:19,931 
They were pounded into me. I was lucky. 

1119 
01:45:20,002 --> 01:45:22,095 
All these things worked for me. 

1120 
01:45:22,171 --> 01:45:25,334 
Everyone worked hard 
to make sure that I was engaged. 

1121 
01:45:25,407 --> 01:45:28,535 
I mean, they knew I was different, 
but not less. 

1122 
01:45:28,878 --> 01:45:30,368 
You know, I had a gift. 

1123 
01:45:30,446 --> 01:45:32,141 
I could see the world in a new way. 

1124 
01:45:32,214 --> 01:45:35,672 
I could see details 
that other people were blind to. 

1125 
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:40,680 
My mother pushed me 
to become self-sufficient. 

1126 
01:45:40,756 --> 01:45:43,486 
I worked summers at my aunt's ranch. 

1127 
01:45:43,559 --> 01:45:47,495 
I went to boarding school and college 
and those things... 

1128 
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:49,531 
Those things 
were uncomfortable for me at first, 

1129 
01:45:49,598 --> 01:45:52,590 
but they helped me 
to open doors to new worlds. 

1130 
01:45:52,668 --> 01:45:56,297 
Excuse me, please, 
but we want to hear everything. 

1131 
01:45:56,372 --> 01:45:58,897 
- Yes. Please. 
- Yes. Please tell us. 

1132 
01:45:58,974 --> 01:46:01,636 
- Please, everything you can tell us. 
- Yes. Tell us, please. 

1133 
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,990 
<i>Are you a scientist?</i> 

1134 
01:46:23,065 --> 01:46:24,123 
- <i>French fish!</i> 
- <i>French fish!</i> 

1135 
01:46:24,199 --> 01:46:26,190 
- <i>You cannot hit people.</i> 
- <i>You think you can figure it out?</i> 

1136 
01:46:26,268 --> 01:46:30,967 
- <i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i> 
- <i>I have a pen and a clipboard.</i> 

1137 
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,871 
<i>Think of it as a door.</i> 

1138 
01:46:32,942 --> 01:46:36,901 
- <i>It just takes one knock to the head.</i> 
- <i>I don't understand why people are cruel</i> 

1139 
01:46:36,979 --> 01:46:39,675 
- <i>for no reason!</i> 
- <i>You have a very special mind.</i> 

1140 
01:46:39,748 --> 01:46:41,773 
<i>You see the world in ways that others can't.</i> 

1141 
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,080 
<i>Miss Grandin, this is a masterpiece.</i> 

1142 
01:46:44,153 --> 01:46:48,317 
- <i>A door opened and I went through it.</i> 
- <i>Yes, you</i> did. 

1143 
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:49,880 
<i>And I held it.</i> 

1144 
01:46:54,129 --> 01:46:56,120 
I'm Temple Grandin.
